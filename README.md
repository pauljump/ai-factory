# AI Factory

**The problem with AI coding agents isn't intelligence — it's amnesia.**

Every session starts from zero. The agent doesn't know that you tried approach X last week and it failed, that module Y has a subtle invariant, or that the deploy requires a flag nobody documented. You re-explain the same context, hit the same walls, and wonder why session 50 doesn't feel faster than session 1.

AI Factory fixes this. It's a CLI that builds a persistent knowledge layer across your projects — harvesting architecture decisions, gotchas, conventions, and playbooks into a searchable store, then automatically injecting the right context into every coding session. The result: compounding returns on every hour you invest.

I built this to run my own monorepo (16 apps, 21 shared packages, TypeScript + Swift). It went from "explain the deploy process every session" to "the agent already knows."

```

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pauljump/ai-factory.git
cd ai-factory
npm install
npm link    # makes `factory` available globally
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new factory workspace
factory init my-factory
cd my-factory

# Import your existing projects
factory convert ~/path/to/your/monorepo

# Or start a new project from scratch
factory new my-app -t api
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `factory init [name]` | Creates a workspace with knowledge store, hooks, and auto-generated CLAUDE.md |
| `factory convert <source>` | Scans existing projects — discovers frameworks, harvests knowledge, copies playbooks, seeds the soul file. Use `--dry-run` to preview. |
| `factory new <name> [-t type]` | Creates a new project (`web`, `api`, `ios`, `pipeline`, `other`) with relevant knowledge pre-loaded |
| `factory scan` | Re-analyzes all projects, regenerates auto-sections of CLAUDE.md |
| `factory status` | Factory dashboard — projects, packages, knowledge stats, session metrics, stale warnings |
| `factory knowledge <action>` | `search <query>`, `rebuild` the FTS5 index, or view `stats` by domain |
| `factory eval` | Run retrieval evaluation — scores knowledge retrieval quality with precision, recall, and MRR metrics |

## How It Works

### Knowledge Harvesting

When you run `factory convert`, the system reads every project's CLAUDE.md, domain knowledge files, and playbooks. It extracts structured knowledge entries — each tagged with domain, confidence level, source project, and verification date. These are stored in SQLite with FTS5 full-text indexing.

### Session Injection

Claude Code hooks fire on every session start. The injection engine:
1. Detects which project you're in (from package.json, project.yml, Dockerfile)
2. Loads the soul file (collaboration style, principles)
3. Matches relevant playbooks by tag
4. Retrieves knowledge entries — prioritizing same-project entries, then tag matches, then full-text search
5. Injects a formatted context payload into the session

### CLAUDE.md Regeneration

`factory scan` auto-generates sections of your workspace CLAUDE.md (stack, project table, package list, knowledge domains, factory health) while preserving your hand-written sections (how you work, what not to build). Uses `<!-- factory:auto-start -->` / `<!-- factory:user-start -->` markers.

### Retrieval Evaluation

`factory eval` runs a suite of test cases against your knowledge store, measuring:
- **Precision** — what fraction of retrieved entries are actually relevant?
- **Recall** — what fraction of relevant entries were retrieved?
- **MRR** (Mean Reciprocal Rank) — how high does the first relevant result rank?

Scorecards are saved to `scorecards/` so you can track retrieval quality as your knowledge base grows.

## Built With

- TypeScript, Node 22, ESM
- SQLite + FTS5 (knowledge search with BM25 ranking)
- Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, Stop)
- commander (CLI framework)
- Vitest (test framework)

## What It Powers

This tool runs a production monorepo with 16 active projects across iOS, web, and backend — including data pipelines, prediction market feeds, a persona simulation engine, and consumer apps on TestFlight. The knowledge store currently holds architecture decisions, deploy playbooks, and cross-project patterns that make launching a new app a single-session operation.
